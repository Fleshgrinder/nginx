# POSIX asynchronous I/O configuration.
#
# You can include this pretty much anywhere wherey you need it. Note that sendfile is automatically disabled. There are
# various other limitations of AIO in Linux as of now. It definitely makes sense for streaming big files.

#
# *Note:* I include the `sendfile off` option to ensure that nginx throws an error in case this and the
# `file-sendfile.conf` are used together in the same configuration block.
